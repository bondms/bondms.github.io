# Regular Expressions

## Look ahead and look behind

Look-ahead and look-behind are features of Perl-style regular expressions that allow a match to be found using a larger portion of the string than is required to be provided back.

### Look-ahead regex example

List the names of MP3 files but without the ".mp3" extension.

`dir -1 | grep --perl-regexp --only-matching ".*(?=\.mp3)"`

### Look-behind regex example

`grep --perl-regexp --only-matching "(?<=prefix).*"`
