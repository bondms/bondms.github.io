# Language

Unlike computer programming languages which are carefully designed, natural languages tend to evolve is less considered ways. This leads to interesting quirks.

## Buffalo buffalo buffalo

The syntatically valid English language sentance ["Buffalo buffalo buffalo"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo) is a well-known example of a quirk of the natuaral language that occurs because "Buffalo" operates as a adjective (attributive noun), verb, and noun.

## The rose rose rose

Inspired by "Buffalo buffalo buffalo", the sentance "The rose rose rose" came to mind.

### Simple version

The rose (red-coloured) rose (flower) rose (grew).

### Longer version

The rose (red-coloured) rose (flower), (that) Rose (named person) rose (has grown), rose (grew).

## The tortoise taught us

Spoken English introduces the opportunity for more quirks. "Tortoise" and "taught us" don't look at all similar when written, but sound similar, if not identical, when spoken.
