# Electric vehicle Charging

These notes are for the UK.

## Public charging

### Locating

Networks typically have their own web or app map to locate their chargers, but there are also solutions that combine many networks:

* A Better Route Planner: [https://abetterrouteplanner.com/](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/)
    * Allows advanced planning of routes which can be customized based on your own preferences (car, driving style, etc).
* ZapMap: [https://www.zap-map.com/](https://www.zap-map.com/)
    * Allows users to provide feedback on charger status etc. so others can avoid faulty units without first having to travel there.

## Jargon

### Charging modes

* Mode 1: Use of a standard domestic socket without safety protection. Limited to 8 Amp / 2 kW. Not suitable for most EVs.
* Mode 2: Use of a stardard domestic socket or a commando socket with an in-cord control and protection device. Limited to 10 Amp / 2.4 kW for domestic sockets, 12 Amp from a commando socket.
* Mode 3: AC fast charging up to 22 kW. May be 1 or 3 phase. A typical 1 phase home charger is limited to 7.4 kW.
* Mode 4: DC fast or rapid charging.

### Connectors

* Type 2: Current European standard supporting 1 and 3 phase AC from 3 to 50 kW.
* CCS-combo: Combines a type-2 connector with additional pins for fast DC charging.
* CHAdeMO: An alternative connector originally popular with Japanese manufacturers.
* Type G (AKA "granny cable"): 3-pin domestic socket.

## Cable limitations

All DC chargers and some AC chargers are tethered. In this case, the tethered cable will be appropriate for the charger, and the charging speed will be the best supported by the combination of the vehicle and the charger.

Some AC chargers, however, are untethered and require the user to provide a cable. In this case, cable selection may limit charging speed below the maximum supported by the combination of the vehicle and the charger.

Consider a user with the following two cables (both being type 2, mode 3):

* 3-phase, 16 Amp (11 kW).
* 1-phase, 32 Amp (7.4 kW).

Although the first cable is rated to a higher power, there are cases where using the second cable may provide a faster charging rate (such as in the first of these scenarios):

* 3.7 kW (1-phase charger @ 16 Amp):
    * Either cable is capable of providing the full 3.7 kW.
* 7.4 kW (1-phase charger @ 32 Amp):
    * The first cable provides only 3.7 kW. The 16 Amp limitation prevents full use of the one available phase.
    * The second cable provides the full 7.4 kW.
* 11 kW (3-phase charger @ 16 Amp):
    * The first cable provides the full 11 kW.
    * The second cable provides 3.7 kW. The cable's single phase prevents use of the the other two phases.
* 22 kW (3-phase charger @ 32 Amp):
    * The first cable provides 11 kW. The cable's 16 Amp limit applies to each phase.
    * The second cable provides 7.4 kW. The cable's single phase prevents use of the the other two phases.

To avoid these potential charging-speed limitations, a more versatile cable could be used that provides 3-phases at 32 Amps. This would avoid the need to carry or select between multiple cables, but such a cable is likely to be bigger, heavier, and more expensive than either of the other options.

## Home charging

### Tariffs

Octopus offer a range of good tariffs with some that are especially good for EV owners. Octopus Go and Octopus Agile both offer cheap off-peak electricity, so are ideal if you can schedule your charging to fit in with off-peak times.

Octopus referral code: [share.octopus.energy/topaz-sheep-824](https://share.octopus.energy/topaz-sheep-824)

Octopus can also arrange fitting of an EV charger at your home.

### Charging speeds

The rate of charging at rapid DC public charging station is dependent on many factors and therefore often unpredictable. Temperature, state of charge, whether other users are using nearby charger, etc. can all affect public charging rates.

Home charging, however, is much more predictable. Here are some examples:

#### Assumptions:

* 78 kWh usable battery capacity and 100% charging efficiency. In practice, a 78 kWh battery will actually have less usable capacity and will charge at less than 100 % efficiency, but the differences should approximately cancel out for these rough estimates.
* Driving economy: 280 kWh per 1000 miles. Adjust the calculations for your own economy which will be affected by car, driving style, weather, traffic, type of roads, etc.
* 4 hours off off-peak electricity per night at 5 pence per kWh, as per [Octopus Go](https://octopus.energy/go/).

#### 6 Amps (typically the lowest configurable charging rate; useful if using an extension lead that isn't designed for continuous high-current use):

* Power: `6 Amps * 240 Volts = 1.44 kW`
* Range gain rate: `1.44 kW / 280 kWh per 1000 miles * 1000 miles = ~5 mph`
* Nightly energy gain: `1.44 kW * 4 h = 5.76 kWh`
* Nightly percentage gain: `5.76 kWh / 78 kWh * 100 =  ~7 %`
* Nightly range gain: `5.76 kWh / 280 kWh per 1000 miles * 1000 miles = ~20 miles`

#### At 10 Amps (maximum rate available from a 13 Amp domestic socket):

* Power: `10 Amps * 240 Volts = 2.4 kW`
* Range gain rate: `2.4 kW / 280 kWh per 1000 miles * 1000 miles = ~8.5 mph`
* Nightly energy gain: `2.4 kW * 4 h = 9.6 kWh`
* Nightly percentage gain: `9.6 kWh / 78 kWh * 100 =  ~12 %`
* Nightly range gain: `9.6 kWh / 280 kWh per 1000 miles * 1000 miles = ~35 miles`

#### At 32 Amps (typical 1-phase home EV charger):

* Power: `32 Amps * 240 Volts = 7.68 kW` (Official rating of 7.4 kW assumes 230 Volts).
* Range gain rate: `7.4 kW / 280 kWh per 1000 miles * 1000 miles = ~26.5 mph`
* Nightly energy gain: `7.4 kW * 4 h = 29.6 kWh`
* Nightly percentage gain: `29.6 kWh / 78 kWh * 100 =  ~38 %`
* Nightly range gain: `29.6 kWh / 280 kWh per 1000 miles * 1000 miles = ~100 miles`
